# DiscordUnitCorrector
A fully functional public Discord bot that automatically corrects non-SI units (imperial, etc) to SI-ones (metric, etc)
This bot will listen for any messages in Discord that contain non-SI units and when detected, reply with the message converted to SI-Units.

Are you tired of a car that weighs 100 Stones, is 10 feet high, and can drive 50 miles at 5 degrees freedom?
Worry no more! Your car weighs 0.64t, is 3.05m high, and can drive 80.47km at -15Â°C from now on!

Simply add this bot to your server! You can choose to run it yourself or use the bot that is updated and hosted by me [Wendelstein 7](https://github.com/Wendelstein7).
